# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using two different approaches: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach). The goal of this project is to compare the performance of these sentiment analysis models on a dataset of Amazon reviews and assess their effectiveness.

## Objectives

- **Compare Sentiment Analysis Models:** Evaluate the VADER sentiment analysis tool and the RoBERTa model on Amazon reviews.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenize and prepare the review text data for analysis.
- **Apply VADER Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze sentiment scores using the VADER tool, which is suitable for short texts and social media.
- **Apply RoBERTa Sentiment Analysis:** Use the RoBERTa model, a transformer-based model known for its strong NLP performance, to analyze sentiment.
- **Compare Results:** Analyze and compare the outputs from VADER and RoBERTa to understand their performance differences.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of Amazon reviews with associated star ratings. This data is utilized to train and test the sentiment analysis models and compare their results.

## Tools and Libraries

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** For text processing and sentiment analysis with VADER.
- **Transformers:** For leveraging the RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib:** For visualizing and comparing sentiment analysis results.
